*_version 0.5_* _(updated 12 June, 09)_


h4. Upgrading :

One new configuration option has been added. Copy paste the old config portion, or just this right there, and also check to see that the new config option is there.

h3. What does it do?

It displays all the image files within a folder as a gallery.

h3. Configurations?

_None_! Put the file in the folder, and see magic unfold!

*Alternatively*, if you want to configure some options, open up @index.php@, and edit these lines 19 through 27. :)

If you want to edit the CSS, it starts from line # 118 in @index.php@.

h3. Requirements?

Images. PHP.
